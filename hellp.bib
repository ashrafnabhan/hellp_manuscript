  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome is one of the most severe forms of preeclampsia and aggravates both maternal and perinatal prognosis. The systematic review available in Cochrane Library compared corticosteroid (dexamethasone, betamethasone, or prednisolone) given during pregnancy, just after delivery or in the postnatal period, or both before and after birth, with placebo or no treatment. Those receiving steroids showed significantly greater improvement in platelet counts which was greater for those receiving dexamethasone than those receiving betamethasone. There was no clear evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on substantive clinical outcomes. These benefits appear to be greater in Class I HELLP syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dexamethasone for accelerating postpartum recovery in patients with Class I HELLP syndrome in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a triple blind randomized controlled trial including women with class I HELLP syndrome, and exclusion criteria were dexamethasone use in the last 15 days before diagnosis of HELLP syndrome; chronic use of corticosteroids; chronic diseases that alter laboratory parameters of HELLP Syndrome, such as chronic liver disease or purpura, patients unable to consent (coma or critical clinical condition) and without accompanying persons that may consent to study participation.Eligible patients will be invited to participate and those who agree will be included in the study and receive placebo or dexamethasone according to a random list of numbers and subjects will receive the study medication every 12 hours for two days.During the study the women will be subject to strict control of blood pressure and urine output. Laboratory tests will be performed at regular intervals during treatment and 24 hours and 48 hours after its suspension. If worsening of clinical or laboratory variables is observed, a rescue scheme of dexamethasone will be administrated. This proposal has already obtained approval of the local Institutional Review Board of the coordinating center (IMIP, Recife, Brazil), all other participating centers and of the National Council for Ethics in Research (CONEP) of the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: Because most morbidity and mortality associated with atypical preeclampsia and the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets is a postpartum phenomenon, we undertook this investigation to evaluate the use of high-dose corticosteroids to minimize maternal morbidity and accelerate postpartum recovery in patients with this form of severe preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: Into this prospective, randomized study 40 parturients with the syndrome were recruited. The syndrome was defined by a clinical presentation consistent with a diagnosis of severe preeclampsia or eclampsia in addition to laboratory evidence of hemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. Immediately post partum 20 parturients assigned to the treatment group received four doses of intravenous dexamethasone at 12-hour intervals (10 mg, 10 mg, 5 mg, 5 mg) over 36 hours. Patients assigned to the control group received no corticosteroids. All study subjects were intensively monitored by mean arterial pressure and urinary output every 2 hours, hematocrit and platelet count every 6 hours and lactic dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase every 12 hours for the first 48 hours post partum. RESULTS: The steroid-treated group with the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets had significant changes over time in mean arterial pressure, urinary output, platelet count, lactic dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase versus the control group with the syndrome. Relative to the control group, the mean arterial pressure became significantly decreased at 22 hours in the steroid-treated group (p < 0.03), urinary output increased significantly by 16 hours (p < 0.02), the platelet count increased significantly by 24 hours (p < 0.05), and both lactic dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase decreased significantly by 36 hours (p < 0.04 and p < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In association with high-dose corticosteroid administration, parturients with the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets recovered from the disease process more rapidly than did control subjects, as measured by urinary output, mean arterial pressure, platelet count, lactic dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase. In this disease process, which has significant associated morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with advanced cases, high-dose corticosteroid therapy appears to significantly hasten recovery and lessen the severity of the disease post partum. We postulate that use of this therapeutic approach in properly selected patients could result in lessened overall maternal morbidity and mortality, shorter patient stays in recovery and intensive-care areas, and shorter overall hospitalization with reduced medical care costs.},

METHOD: The puerperal courses of 17 mothers who initially received dexamethasone after delivery were compared to 17 other mothers with HELLP syndrome who received no corticosteroids during the puerperium course. Treated patients immediately received 10 mg of dexamethasone post-partum (intravenously) followed 12 h later by 10 mg and 10 mg at 24 h post-partum, to a total of 30 mg. RESULTS: The steroid treated group had significant changes over time in platelet count. Relative to the control group the platelet count increased significantly by 30 h post-partum (P < 0.01). The blood pressure, urinary output, lactic dehydrogenase, aspartato aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase values were not significantly different between the dexamethasone and control group at any time by 72 h post-partum. CONCLUSION: Parturients with HELLP syndrome who received a short course of post-partum dexamethasone therapy had an accelerated recovery from their platelet count, but not from their liver enzymes and blood pressure.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether corticosteroid administration to patients with antepartum HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome would alter laboratory values diagnostic for the disease. STUDY DESIGN: Cases of 37 women with antepartum HELLP syndrome managed between March 1995 and July 1999 were reviewed. Patients were classified on the basis of exposure to corticosteroids and to the dose used. Group 1 did not receive corticosteroids. Group 2 received a standard corticosteroid dosage regimen for promotion of fetal lung maturation. Group 3 received a high-dose corticosteroid regimen of >24 mg/d (most frequently 10 mg dexamethasone as an intravenous bolus dose every 6 hours for 2 doses followed by 6 mg as an intravenous bolus dose every 6 hours for 2 to 4 doses). Antepartum changes in laboratory values from diagnosis to delivery were evaluated by means of the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Eleven patients did not receive corticosteroids, 15 were given a standard dose, and 11 received high-dose therapy. For each laboratory value assessed (platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase activity, and lactate dehydrogenase activity), the corticosteroid groups differed significantly from the no-treatment group (P </=.002 for all). A further, significantly greater improvement in platelet count was noted between the high-dose group (81%) and the standard-dose group (17%; P =.04). The interval from diagnosis to delivery was also longer for patients treated with the high-dose protocol (51 +/- 25 hours) than for both those treated with a standard regimen (26 +/- 20 hours) and those who received no treatment (13 +/- 11 hours; P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Administration of corticosteroids to patients with antepartum HELLP syndrome improves platelet count, reduces liver enzyme abnormalities, and prolongs latency to delivery in a dose-dependent manner. Higher doses of corticosteroid than those traditionally prescribed for promotion of fetal pulmonary maturation should be considered for maternal and fetal benefits in cases of severe preeclampsia.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the impact of antepartum administration of corticosteroids on the course of the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) in pregnancies at 24 to 37 weeks' gestation. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective, randomized study was undertaken in 25 antepartum patients with atypical severe preeclampsia expressed as HELLP syndrome. Twelve pregnant women were randomized to receive double-dose dexamethasone (10 mg intravenously every 12 hours) until delivery, and 13 women were randomized to the control arm. Management and delivery decisions for all patients were based on a common protocol, with delivery undertaken for a deteriorating maternal or fetal condition. RESULTS: In the corticosteroid-treated group the maternal platelet count significantly increased (p = 0.006), whereas lactic dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase significantly decreased over time (p = 0.03 and p = 0.005) in comparison to the 13 women who did not receive corticosteroids. Maternal urinary output after entry into the study was significantly increased within hours after steroid administration versus the control group (p = 0.0006). The study entry-to-delivery interval (41 +/- 15 hours) was significantly longer in the group of steroid-treated women (p = 0.0068). CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization and significant improvement in the laboratory and clinical parameters associated with HELLP syndrome occurred in women who received high-dose antenatal corticosteroids, as measured by maternal platelet count, urinary output, lactic dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and postponement of delivery. We believe the findings of this investigation permit us to speculate that this therapeutic approach could enhance maternal-fetal care by postponing delivery of some previable fetuses, reduce the need for maternal transfusion of blood products, reduce neonatal morbidity or mortality from multiple systemic effects, and facilitate a safer transfer of the ill mother to a tertiary care site for optimal peripartal care.},

METHODS: A prospective, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken in a total of 60 pregnant women with HELLP syndrome who were treated at the perinatology department of the study center between January 2005 and February 2008. Betamethasone treatment (intramuscular injection of 12 mg in every 24 h) was given to 30 subjects while remaining 30 subjects received placebo. The treatment and control groups were compared in the aspects of clinical outcome and laboratory data. RESULTS: The alterations in platelet counts, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels of women treated with betamethasone were statistically similar to those of the placebo group. Although there was a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure values of control group (P = 0.04), alterations in systolic blood pressure values were statistically indifferent in both study groups. Hematological and metabolic complications occurred significantly less in women treated with betamethasone (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the percentage of women who received platelet transfusion was significantly higher in the control group (P < 0.005). No case of maternal mortality occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The betamethasone treatment has ended up with insignificant alterations in clinical outcomes and laboratory data of women with HELLP syndrome except beneficial effects on metabolic complications and need for platelet transfusion. Further investigation is required to assess the efficiency of betamethasone in management of HELLP syndrome.},

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of prednisolone on HELLP syndrome by assessing several markers of the inflammatory response and hepatic damage associated with HELLP syndrome. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Single-center, tertiary obstetric care facility at the University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands. POPULATION: Study subjects included normal controls, patients with non-HELLP preeclampsia, and patients with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. METHODS: HELLP syndrome was defined by hemolysis (serum lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] >600 IU/L and/or haptoglobin <or=0.3 g/L), elevated liver enzymes (serum aspartate aminotransferase [AST] >70 U/L and/or serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] >70 U/L), and a low platelet count (<100 x 10(9)/L). Blood samples from patients with HELLP syndrome who were receiving either prednisolone or placebo were obtained before, during, and after a HELLP exacerbation in the antepartum period. Plasma levels of CRP, IL-1RA, IL-6, sIL-6R, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and GSTA1-1 were determined. Samples from women with preeclampsia but without HELLP syndrome and from healthy pregnant women were included as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma levels of CRP, IL-1RA, IL-6, sIL-6R, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and GSTA1-1. RESULTS: During a HELLP exacerbation CRP, IL-6, IL-1Ra, and GSTA1-1 levels are significantly increased (p < 0.01). In the group of patients treated with prednisolone, significantly lower IL-6 levels were observed during a HELLP exacerbation, compared with patients who did not receive prednisolone (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: HELLP syndrome is associated with an increased inflammatory response. Circulating IL-6 levels in HELLP syndrome are reduced during prednisolone administration, suggesting a stabilizing effect on the inflammatory endothelial process.},

A total dose of 30 mg intravenous dexamethasone was given to the study group during the 36 h following the childbirth, while the control group did not receive any steroid medication. Arterial blood pressure, urine output, hematocrit ratio, platelet count, serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases and uric acid levels were monitored during the first 48 h postpartum. The data were analyzed by unpaired t-test, chi2 or Fisher's exact tests. RESULT: Before the treatment, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. The study group showed statistically significant improvement in mean arterial blood pressure, mean serum aspartate aminotransferase level, mean urine volume per hour and mean platelet count (P < 0.05). Length of hospitalization was also shorter in the study group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Early postpartum high-dose corticosteroid treatment accelerates the recovery and shortens the hospitalization of the parturients with HELLP syndrome.},

METHODS: A randomized trial of 180 mg methylprednisolone or placebo administered in divided doses over 36 hours was conducted in women admitted for preeclampsia and platelet counts below 150×10/L in four French academic centers. Patients were not included when platelet counts were below 50×10/L or when immediate delivery was required. The primary study outcome was the proportion of patients with platelet counts above 100×10/L 36 hours after the first dose of study medication. The total sample size needed to detect a 23% difference in the rate of this outcome between groups with a one-tailed α of 0.05 and 90% power was 94 patients. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive methylprednisolone and 34 placebo between October 2007 and May 2011. Platelet counts above 100×10/L at 36 hours after the first dose of study medication were recorded in 30 (83%) in the active group and 29 (85%) in the placebo group (relative risk 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.80-1.20; P=.82). The only adverse potentially study-related event was hyperglycemia in one woman allocated to methylprednisolone. CONCLUSION: In women with preeclampsia and platelet counts under 150×10/L, methylprednisolone was not effective in maintaining platelet counts above 100×10/L.

Efficacy end points included laboratory values (platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase activity, aspartate aminotransferase activity) and clinical parameters (mean arterial pressure, urinary output). RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled in the study, 19 in the dexamethasone arm and 21 in the betamethasone arm. The adjusted time-averaged changes from baseline were significant for aspartate aminotransferase activity (dexamethasone, -20.4 +/- 9.6 U/L; betamethasone, 9.9 +/- 8.9 U/L; P =.029), mean arterial pressure (dexamethasone, -15.6 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; betamethasone, -8.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; P <.001), and urinary output (dexamethasone, 12.9 +/- 8.6 mL/h; betamethasone, -11.9 +/- 8.2 mL/h; P =.043).

METHODS: the present study is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone in patients with HELLP syndrome. This sample of patients was composed of patients in the puerperium, with the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome (diagnosis made before or after delivery) who were not chronic corticosteroid users and not carriers of any chronic disease which could modify HELLP syndrome's laboratorial parameters. Patients who were too critical or whose condition did not allow them to consent to participate were not included. Data were extracted from the records used in the randomized clinical trial. Age, parity, gestational age at admission and delivery, time of diagnosis (before or after delivery), HELLP syndrome classification (partial or complete), arterial blood pressure, and diuresis at admission were considered for analysis. Among laboratorial findings, hemoglobin, platelet count, liver enzymes, LDH, and serum bilirubin were analyzed. Complications presented by the patients were also analyzed as well as need of blood transfusions and duration of hospitalization. Analysis was made by the Epi-Info 3.3.2 program. RESULTS: one hundred and five patients were analyzed. Age varied from 14 to 49 years (means of 26.7). Regarding parity, 56 patients (53.8%) were primiparas. Analyzing the timing of the diagnosis, 47 patients (45.2%) had the diagnosis before delivery. The mean gestational age in these patients was 32.4 weeks. Hemorrhagic manifestations were observed in 36 patients (34.3%), oliguria was present in 49 patients (46.7%) and criteria for acute renal failure were seen in 21 (20%) of the cases. Hemotransfusions were necessary in 35 (33.3%) patients. Seven patients (6.7%) had pulmonary edema and four patients died, corresponding to 3.8% of the cases. The mean time from diagnosis of HELLP syndrome to discharge or death was 10.3 days, varying from 1 to 33 days. CONCLUSIONS: HELLP syndrome is an ominous diagnosis, which implicates in elevated maternal morbimortality. Among complications, oliguria and hemorrhagic manifestations were the most common findings and hemotransfusions were frequently required. Lethality reached 3.8%.},

METHODS: This study was a randomized, blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing the use of dexamethasone postpartum (10 mg-10 mg-5 mg-5 mg intravenously every 12 hours) with a saline control in patients with severe preeclampsia. The Student t and chi(2) tests were used for data analysis, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: Data from 157 patients (77 patients receiving dexamethasone, 80 patients receiving placebo) who were treated during 2000-2003 were analyzed. Demographics, diagnostic criteria, baseline laboratory values, and postpartum outcomes were similar between groups. Although dexamethasone-treated patients had fewer returns (6.5% compared with 11.3%) to the labor/delivery/recovery unit for uncontrolled hypertension than control patients, no significant differences were found in blood pressure, antihypertensive requirements, laboratory values, length of hospitalization, interval urine output at 48 hours postpartum, or major maternal morbidity. Two control patients developed hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive use of intravenous dexamethasone for postpartum patients with severe preeclampsia does not reduce disease severity or duration. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I.},

METHODS: A prospective, mixed randomized/non-randomized clinical investigation of patients with postpartum HELLP syndrome. Treatment with either dexamethasone or betamethasone was continued until there was evidence of disease recovery. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of both the dexamethasone (n=18) and betamethasone (n=18) groups were similar. Although the time to discharge from the obstetrical recovery room was not statistically significant between groups, reduction in mean arterial blood pressure was more pronounced in the dexamethasone group as compared with the betamethasone group (-15.3+/-1.4 mmHg vs. -7.5+/-1.4 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01). Patients in the dexamethasone group required less antihypertensive treatment than the betamethasone group (6% vs. 50%, P=0.01) and also had a decreased need for readmission to the obstetrical recovery room (0% vs. 22%, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: This investigation supports the use of dexamethasone as the superior glucocorticoid to use for patients with postpartum HELLP syndrome.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is a relatively common complication of pregnancy. HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome is a severe manifestation of pre-eclampsia with significant morbidity and mortality for pregnant women and their children. Corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of HELLP syndrome in the belief that they improve outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of corticosteroids on women with HELLP syndrome and their children. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing any corticosteroid with placebo, no treatment, or other drug; or comparing one corticosteroid with another corticosteroid or dosage in women with HELLP syndrome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials (550 women) compared corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment. There was no difference in the risk of maternal death (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 3.21), maternal death or severe maternal morbidity (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.12), or perinatal/infant death (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.97). The only clear effect of treatment on individual outcomes was improved platelet count (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.10). The effect on platelet count was strongest for women who commenced treatment antenatally (SMD 0.80, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.35).Two trials (76 women) compared dexamethasone with betamethasone. There was no clear evidence of a difference between groups in respect to perinatal/infant death (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.17) or severe perinatal/infant morbidity or death (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48). Maternal death and severe maternal morbidity were not reported. In respect to platelet count, dexamethasone was superior to betamethasone (MD 6.02, 95% CI 1.71 to 10.33), both when treatment was commenced antenatally (MD 8.10, 95% CI 6.23 to 9.97) and postnatally (MD 3.70, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.44). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on substantive clinical outcomes. Those receiving steroids showed significantly greater improvement in platelet counts which was greater for those receiving dexamethasone than those receiving betamethasone. There is to date insufficient evidence of benefits in terms of substantive clinical outcomes to support the routine use of steroids for the management of HELLP. The use of corticosteroids may be justified in clinical situations in which increased rate of recovery in platelet count is considered clinically worthwhile.},

  abstract           = {Corticosteroids are potent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, which are used in the treatment of a wide range of medical disorders. During pregnancy, several corticosteroids are administered for maternal as well as fetal reasons. Prednisone and prednisolone show limited transplacental passage and are thus used for treatment of maternal disease. Dexamethasone and betamethasone, drugs that can easily cross the placenta, are more suitable for fetal indications. During the last decade, administration of corticosteroids was introduced in the treatment of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP syndrome), a severe form of preeclampsia unique to human pregnancy. Several randomized, controlled trials as well as other prospective and retrospective studies have been performed to investigate this beneficial effect of corticosteroids on biochemical measures and clinical signs. This review discusses the characteristics of corticosteroids in humans and details the use of corticosteroids during pregnancy. A review of literature on the effect of corticosteroids on HELLP syndrome is given and possible mechanisms of action are discussed.},

Biological parameters of the Hellp syndrome were analysed just before the first bolus of either treatment (H0), then after 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours. The corticotherapy was more efficient than placebo, in the correction of the biological parameters of the hellp syndrome. It permitted a rapid correction of the thrombopenia (from the 24th hour) but its effect on hemolysis marker was later (from the 36th hour). The kinetic of the hepatic cytolysis marker was not modified by corticotherapy. Finally, the administration of corticosteroids does not reduce maternal morbidity related to HELLP Syndrome.},

  abstract               = {Objectives
To evaluate the effect of prolonged administration of high-dose prednisolone on early onset HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome during expectant management.
Study design
A randomized, double-blind trial was performed in 31 pregnant women with HELLP syndrome with an onset before 30 weeks gestation. Patients received either 50mg prednisolone or placebo intravenously twice a day. Primary outcome measures were the entry-to-delivery interval and the number of recurrent HELLP exacerbations in the antepartum period.
Results
Serious maternal morbidity was considerable, in particular in the placebo group where even on maternal occurred as a consequence of liver rupture. The mean entry-delivery interval did not differ between the prednisolone group (6.9 days) and the placebo group (8.0 days). However, patients in the prednisolone group had a significant lower risk of a recurrent HELLP exacerbation after the initial crisis had subsided, as compared to patients in the placebo group (HR 0.3, with 95% CI 0.3–0.9). Platelet count recovered faster in the prednisolone group as compared to the placebo group (mean 1.7 days versus 6.2 days, P<0.01).
Conclusions
HELLP syndrome remote from term causes high risk for serious maternal morbidity and mortality. When expectant management is pursued in selected patients with a HELLP syndrome remote from term, prolonged administration of prednisolone reduces the risk of recurrent HELLP syndrome exacerbations.},

Treatment has generally been limited to supportive measures and management of complications, but recent clinical trials--which were not double-blind or placebo-controlled--suggest that dexamethasone may stabilize the disorder and even improve it in the antepartum period, maximizing postpartum recovery. The present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 132 women, 60 of them pregnant and 72 puerperal, who met criteria for complete HELLP syndrome. They were randomly assigned to a treatment or placebo group and in the former case received 10 mg dexamethasone intravenously at 12-hour intervals until delivery and three further doses after delivery. The puerperal women received three doses of dexamethasone. All women received, in addition, magnesium sulfate intravenously and, when needed, an antihypertensive agent, initially nifedipine and subsequently clonidine or amlodipine if necessary to lower the diastolic blood pressure.},

  abstract        = {The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of dexamethasone for treatment of HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count) syndrome. A prospective, double-blind clinical trial was conducted among 132 women with HELLP syndrome who were assigned randomly to treatment or placebo groups. Pregnant women in the experimental group received 10-mg doses of dexamethasone intravenously every 12 hours until delivery and 3 additional doses after delivery. Puerperal women received 3 10-mg doses of dexamethasone after delivery. The same schedule was used in the placebo group. The main outcome variable was the duration of hospitalization. In addition, we evaluated treatment effects on the time to recovery of laboratory and clinical parameters and on frequency of complications. The mean duration of hospitalization of patients who received dexamethasone therapy was shorter than in the placebo group (6.5 vs 8.2 days), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = .37). No significant differences were found in the time to recovery of platelet counts (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.8), lactate dehydrogenase (hazard ratio, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5-1.5), aspartate aminotransferase (hazard ratio, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-1.1) and to the development of complications. The results were found in both pregnant and puerperal women. The results of this investigation do not support the use of dexamethasone for treatment of HELLP syndrome.},
